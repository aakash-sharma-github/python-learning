# Day 81
# Hybrid and hierarchical inheritance
# By using two or more different inheritance concept for creating a new inheritted class is known as hybrid inheritance.
# class baseClass:
#     pass

# class derivedClass(baseClass):
#     pass

# class derivedClass1(baseClass):
#     pass

# class derivedClass2(baseClass, derivedClass1):
#     pass

# Hierarchical inheritance
# By using one class different classes are inheriting from it is known as hierarchical inheritance.
# It always create tree like structure hierarchy.
# class baseClass:
#     pass

# class derivedClass(baseClass):
#     pass
# class derivedClass1(baseClass):
#     pass

# class derivedClass2(baseClass, derivedClass):
#     pass

# class derivedClass3(baseClass, derivedClass2):
#     pass
